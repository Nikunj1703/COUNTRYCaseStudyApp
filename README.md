# COUNTRYCaseStudyApp

Developed an Android/Windowâ€™s phone application using PhoneGap, JQuery Mobile, HTML5 CSS3 and BootStrap. This application is
device independent and works efficiently on Desktop, Tablets, Mobile phone etc. Due to confidentiality concerns, only few chunks
application can be made available on public portals.

This application works as a marketing tool to capture young-generation as a customer base in the insurance domain. We developed
this application as a part of Case Study Competition in COUNTRY Financial during the Summer-2015 internship. In the competition
our team won 3'rd prize worth $1500.
